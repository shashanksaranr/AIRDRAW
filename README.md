# AIRDRAW
AirDraw is an innovative computer vision project that allows users to draw in the air using just hand gestures, without touching any device! It uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time, enabling a seamless and intuitive drawing experience on a virtual blackboard.
