# AirDraw Application
AirDraw is an innovative computer vision project that allows users to draw in the air using just hand gestures, without touching any device! It uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time, enabling a seamless and intuitive drawing experience on a virtual blackboard.

# Features

# Technologies Used

Python

# How it Works

The application captures live video from your webcam.

It detects your hand and tracks the position of your index finger.

Movement of the finger is translated into drawing on a virtual canvas.

Additional gestures or keyboard controls allow pausing, resuming, clearing, and customizing the drawing experience.
